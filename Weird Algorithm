/*
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. 
The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:
3→10→5→16→8→4→2→1

Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.
